This type of magic was developed with the sole purpose of repelling the insects used by that individual.

By using ""Triple Maximize Magic,"" Ainz can summon about three swords that gave off a black light while floating in midair.

While this spell was excellent for spying, you couldn�t say that it was the absolute best there was. Though it was invisible, it could easily be detected by second-tier detection spells. Plus, even though it was intangible, if it was destroyed in an attack, the caster would receive damage as feedback. Since this was also considered divination, the opponent could find his location through anti-divination measures or an attack could come flying over if it triggered any automated defenses."

9,Nuclear Blast,"When used with Maximize Magic, this 9th tier spell was powerful enough to entirely consume the space between the user and their target in an instant. However, the user will also be caught in the range of the spell's attack. The spell does composite damage (half fire, half bludgeoning) and it was one of the weaker 9th tier spells in terms of damage. Nonetheless, it had a very large area of effect to the point that if the surrounding buildings are present, those large objects would have been swept away in the middle of that explosion. In that respect, the spell was superior to almost all others as it can generate all kinds of negative status effects. This includes poisoning, blindness, deafness, and so on. Anything of the Evil Lord's level would be able to resist it with their raw statistics alone. It possessed a very powerful knockback effect. Ainz stated that he could even cast this spell with Widen Magic to increase the area and range of its effect if need be."

9,Vermilion Nova,"A 9th tier spell. It is an attack targeting the opponent with a pillar of flame while dealing fire-based type of damage. Ainz considered it be the highest-level, super-tier magic notwithstanding, single-target anti-personnel fire-element attack spell that he is capable of. This spell could be used in combination with both Triplet Magic and Maximize Magic together."

9,Perfect Warrior,"The spell allows Ainz to convert his magic caster levels into an equivalent number of warrior levels. By using that spell, he could temporarily become a half-baked level 100 warrior. It also carried the benefit of being able to use certain pieces of arms and armor that would normally require specific job classes to access without penalty. This would include freely utilizing any weapons and it's abilities shown during his fight with Shalltear. However, there were many drawbacks to that spell. The first weakness was that he could not cast other spells while the magic was in effect. In addition, he would not gain any special warrior skills from the spell, and his recalculated ability scores would be lower than an actual warrior. Secondly, sustaining the transformation spell and other magic would both lower his mana and mana recovery rates to zero. This form was enough when matching blades with second-rate combatants like priests and the like, but he would stand no chance of winning against an opponent who was a dedicated warrior."

10,Create Fortress,"A 10th tier spell that summons forth a mighty fortress over 30 meters tall tower out of thin air. In YGGDRASIL, anyone on the same team could open those doors with a touch. All others would have to break them down. In the new world, the door will not open for the allies. A pair of double doors faced the entrance, and a passage stretched beyond them. At the end of the passage was yet another set of double doors. The way was lit by magical lights, so there were no problems traveling along it. Inside, there was a round hall. The floor was as white as snow, and the ceiling was high above. A spiral staircase coiled up from the center of the room and connected to the upper levels.
