        **Planned Functionality:**
        - Display a timeline of significant events in the character's life, similar to Dwarf Fortress's NPC experiences.
        - Include events like battles fought, skills learned, relationships formed, and major life milestones.
        - Allow adding, editing, and deleting events with details (e.g., date, description, participants).
        - Integrate with other systems (e.g., quests, classes) to auto-generate some events.
        - Intended to help an AI take over for a player when they wish to control a different character and this one becomes an NPC.
        - Current Status: Placeholder - awaiting design finalization.
